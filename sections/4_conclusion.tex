\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:4}
Data streams have received considerable attention in various communities. The naive methods are unsuitable for real-time processing, especially when the number of stream sequences is vast. In this paper, I have explained six different methods for efficiently discovering correlation in time-series. Specifically, I first discussed the algorithms that detect global correlation in time-series. Then, I discussed the local correlation algorithms. Moreover, I described the evaluation for all approaches on several data sets, indicating that they can discover correlations more efficiently and effectively. If you have a task to explore, then you can choose one of them, or you can always combine these methods. For example, you do not want to implement the whole DFT logic, so you take a naive approach and improve it with piecewise linear representation. As a result, you get your algorithm with improved time and space complexity. You can always extend your knowledge about discovering correlation by the papers from the references list and then find others when using the ontological technique like snowballing in systematic literature studies and a replication in software engineering~\cite{ref9}.
