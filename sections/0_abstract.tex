This paper addresses the challenges in detecting the correlation among time-series data streams, which facilitates the research of data stream mining, pattern discovery, and potential anomaly detection. I focus on two types of correlations: global correlation and local correlation with time delay. The traditional method is unsuitable for real-time processing, especially when the number of stream sequences is enormous. This paper proposes effective methods based on different mathematical and approximation techniques to detect the correlation among time-series data streams continuously. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic data sets verify the efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability of the following possible solutions: up to 40k times efficiency improvement.
